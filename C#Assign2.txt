Text Answers for Assignment 2 (C#)

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
We can use String when we have a small number of concatenation operations or when working with immutable strings, as String objects are immutable and any modification 
creates a new string, resulting in additional memory usage and overhead. This is suitable for simple concatenations or dealing with user input that doesn't change frequently. 
We can use StringBuilder for applications that require numerous concatenation operations. StringBuilder is mutable, allowing modifications in place without creating new objects, 
making it more efficient for building large text data.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
We can sort an array in C# using the Array.Sort method.
Array.Sort(numbers);

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
The Length property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in the array.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No, System.Array is a collection of elements that are of the same type. 
If there is a scenario which requires to store multiple data types, a collection of type object can be used.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
The CopyTo() method transfers elements from the current array to an existing array, starting at a specific index, and requires that the destination array already has enough space. 
On the other hand, the Clone() method creates a new array with the same elements as the original, meaning you get a completely separate copy; changes to this new array won't 
affect the original one.
